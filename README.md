## TS config for advent of code

### Reading input

```
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

const input = readFileSync("./input.txt", "utf-8");
```

### Running ts file

`npx ts-node file.ts`

### Historic
2019 is not TS, it is here just for remembering the first time :p

2020 was when I started to use fs for reading input and TS

2021 let's have fun :tada:
